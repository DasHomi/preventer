# Preventer

A client side fabric mod that prevents you from doing dumb things by accident, like breaking blocks you don't want to break, or placing blocks you don't want to place.
(e.g. accidentally creating stripped logs or breaking budding amethyst)  
The whole mod is highly configurable, so you can disable any feature you don't want.
The config can be reached in game by pressing `I` or via the "Mod menu" mod.
If you want to temporarily disable the entire mod, use the _Override Key_ (_default keybinding:_ `R`).
