# Preventer

A fabric mod that prevents you from doing dumb things by accident.
For example accidentally creating stripped logs.
You can toggle every module in the settings and decide if 
you want a notification from the mod if it prevented you from doing something.
There is also an OVERRIDE KEY to temporarily allow an otherwise prevented action (_Default keybinding is R_).
