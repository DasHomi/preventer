# Preventer

Preventer is a collection of **over thirty** modules who prevent you from doing certain actions (e.g. accidentally breaking budding amethyst or stripping logs). 
Each module can be enabled or disabled individually in game via a config screen (press `I`) or all modules can be temporarily disabled with the _Override Key_ (hold `R`) .
